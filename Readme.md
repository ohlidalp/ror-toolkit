Wikipage: http://www.rigsofrods.com/wiki/pages/RoRToolkit

## Features:

Editing maps (.terrn format)
Editing map objects (.odef format)
Editing vehicles (.truck format)

## How to start

Startup settings dialog
NOTE: Currently, only Windows version is supported. Linux status is unknown. Get in touch with developers for more info.

Download from forum thread [RoRToolkit is coming back to life](http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/120839)

Installation: Just unpack the archive. No installation is required.


Main screen
Startup: Doubleclick "rortoolkit.bat". You'll be shown a "Startup settings dialog". Perform the following steps:

* Step1: Select RoR installation directory. At the moment, it MUST be an installation of RoR 0.38 - other versions will either not be detected at all or won't start properly
* Step2: Select RoR home directory. On windows, this is [MyDocuments/Rigs of Rods *]. RoRToolkit will detect all available directories and show a selection list. Choose any. However, RoRToolkit only supports editing maps in .terrn format, which is only supported in 0.38 and older versions.
* Step3: Choose a rendering system. On windows, both work fine - choose any.
* Step4: The "start" button will become enabled once you complete steps 1+2. Click it.
Then, RoRToolkit starts up the 3D engine, loads resources (this may take a while, it loads everything, users already complained) and you'll land in the main screen.
