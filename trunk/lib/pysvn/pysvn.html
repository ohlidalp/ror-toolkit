<h1>pysvn - Python interface to Subversion</h1>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The <a href="pysvn_prog_guide.html">pysvn Programmer's Guide</a> is the best place to start learning about pysvn.
It covers the use of pysvn in a tutorial style with lots of examples.
</p>
<p>Use the <a href="pysvn_prog_ref.html">pysvn Programmer's Reference</a> to look up the detailed descriptions
of all the classes, functions and variables of pysvn.
</p>
<p>The <i>python-library</i>/site-packages/pysvn/Examples/Client/svn_cmd.py program is a complete replacement
for the svn command line written using pysvn. It is a good place to look for working examples of use of all
the pysvn module.
